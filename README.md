# DistortionPedal
This is the schematic (simulated in LTSpice) for a custom distortion circuit.

A classic "fuzz face" pedal design was used and modified with tone and volume controls. The LPF cutoff is around 720 Hz and the HPF cutoff is around 153 Hz. 

To run, download the file, open and run it in LTSpice.
When the .raw file pops up, go back to the schematic and click on the Vout and Vin nodes to plot the voltages at these nodes and compare the input and output signals.
